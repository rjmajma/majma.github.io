<h2>All about me</h2>
<img class="feature" src="../images/content/profile.jpg" alt="A picture of me">


<p>I&rsquo;m a web designer with 10 years experience improving citizen interaction with government. I&rsquo;ve worked on government design projects at the White House, for Hawaii, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and many other governments across the country. My career in government design began in 2004 working as designer, then later as creative director for RI.gov (the official website for all things Rhode Island government). My employer, private-sector company <abbr>NIC</abbr>, is a provider of digital government services in various states across the country. </p>

<p>Recently, I served as a member of the inaugural class of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows/round-1-fellows">Presidential Innovation Fellows at the White House</a>. My project team: MyGov, was charged with reinventing the relationship between citizens and government. MyGov (now MyUSA), went from white board sketch to private beta in six months, with a public launch to follow soon.</p> 

<p>After my time in Washington, recent work has taken me to Hawaii to redesign Hawaii.gov, Madison, <abbr title="Wisconsin">WI</abbr> to mentor a design team working on Wisconsin.gov, and the <a href="http://acp.risd.edu/?page_id=442">Rhode Island School of Design</a>, where I had the opportunity to speak with students studying how we can use design to improve our experience on election day. This spring, I will be a <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/18267"><abbr title="South by Southwest">SXSW</abbr> panelist</a> discussing the merits of building static websites.</p>

<p>Recent work aside, I believe that design can and does change our interactions with government, and in turn, how we experience our democracy. There is much work still to be done. Good thing I enjoy doing it.</p>
